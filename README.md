# Doodle_Jump_Game-
This is my first rather large project, which I developed for no more than a month, taking into account extraneous matters, activities and hobbies.
I present to you my version of the game "Doodle Jump", written in C # + Windows Forms. The game consists of three main forms and a bunch of classes for game objects (main + auxiliary).
Advantages:
- On the basis of serialization, reading and writing game data and broadcasting them in real time is done.
- Added sound effects for certain player actions.
- Provided the physics of the movements of the game object, so that the game seemed believable.
- Designed (in Photoshop) own game interface (allocated space on the playing field with statistics) for the convenience of the player.
- Added about 8 character skins + ~5 different enemies + auxiliary items and coins.
  
maybe there will be updates...
